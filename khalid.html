                    <p class="p2" style="opacity: 1;">This year we staged an extraordinary event. named Portal "Out
                        Of Time". It was about different topics associated with technology, like programming,
                        startups, web development, graphic design, mobile development, and talk about CV. These
                        topics were represented by brilliant presenters. It was held on February 26. We did a big
                        media campaign on our different social platforms and we reached more than 200 audiences.</p>

                    <h2>Mega event</h2>
                    <p class="p2" style="opacity: 1;">To carry out a successful event, we must focus on the planning
                        stage, this is the most important stage to achieve the proposed objectives. It is necessary to
                        visualize what we want to achieve, without this we will not be able to measure the results and
                        verify that the proposed objective was achieved. In the planning process, the audience to whom
                        we are directing our event is considered, what motivates them and what does not, what their
                        needs are and how our event fits in with this. No matter the type of event we are organizing, or
                        the way in which we reach the participants, planning is the only guarantee of success.</p>
