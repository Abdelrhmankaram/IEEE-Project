                    <p class="p2" style="opacity: 1;">This year we staged an extraordinary event. named Portal "Out
                        Of Time". It was about different topics associated with technology, like programming,
                        startups, web development, graphic design, mobile development, and talk about CV. These
                        topics were represented by brilliant presenters. It was held on February 26. We did a big
                        media campaign on our different social platforms and we reached more than 200 audiences.</p>
